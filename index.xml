Thorough testing before merging to master is great, but it doesn’t reveal the unknowns. Staging on shared environments tends to be slow, unreliable and costly to support. Why not just learn from the only true environment by conducting safe and efficient experiments?

Deploy continuously, move faster. Why? Won’t things break? What are the benefits for the teams and their stakeholders? Do those also apply to the “deep” back-end systems?
At bol.com (one of the biggest online retailers of the Netherlands), feature teams enjoy lots of autonomy. We can press the &amp;ldquo;deploy&amp;rdquo; button at any moment. Theoretically. Practically, there are non-technical obstacles, like: &amp;ldquo;testing isn't complete, the rest of the changes must wait.</description></item><item><title>Sprinkle sprinkle Kotlin sugar - small big shifts in test preparation</title><link>https://mgurov.github.io/talks/kotlin-for-testability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2019 12:51:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mgurov.github.io/talks/kotlin-for-testability/</guid><description>On Kotling helping to bringing the joy back to TDD</description></item><item><title>WIP – Mocks: is more always better?</title><link>https://mgurov.github.io/talks/mockless-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 21:04:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mgurov.github.io/talks/mockless-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mocking and stubbing are, without any doubt, important techniques for a modern software developer to master.

Mainly with feature teams in Logistics and Purchasing domains, but also with platform teams.
Some highlights:
pioneered the use of Docker for CI testing against the real databases (Oracle, Postgres) and messaging (Oracle AQ, bol.com’s and google’s proprietary pub/sub).
paved the way for the adoption of Postgres and within a company originally deeply rooted in Oracle (java dev side).</description></item><item><title>Spring @Transactional programmatically</title><link>https://mgurov.github.io/posts/0004-programmatic-spring-transactional/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 19:02:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mgurov.github.io/posts/0004-programmatic-spring-transactional/</guid><description>Beware: this post is WIP.
An an enterprise developer, it's easy to get used to the conveniences of Spring (Boot) so much that it becomes an issue on itself. Take @Transactional. Arguably, one of the few core features of Spring that does make us more productive in development. But at times it can be slightly inconvenient to rely solely on annotation for transaction boundary setup:
It might not be desireable to have a database transaction open throughout the whole request processing, e.</description></item><item><title>Postgres jsonb_agg children cart</title><link>https://mgurov.github.io/posts/0003-jsonb_agg_children/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:57:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mgurov.github.io/posts/0003-jsonb_agg_children/</guid><description>&lt;p>Selecting lists of related entities from RDBMS'es can be a chore at times.

Setting it up isn't free. Careless tests composition can lead to much time wasted on re-creating those contexts, and will make running tests painfully long very quickly. There are simple techniques of keeping this overhead to the minimum. Ideally – start only one test context for the whole run.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
