The highlights of this technique are the minimal deviation from the production configuration or code, and very limited use of mocking. Thanks to higher tier positioning on the testing pyramid, the tests written with this technique are quite implementation-agnostic, and excel in supporting structural refactorings or high-level documentation of the component behavior.</description></item><item><title>WIP – Mocks: is more always better?</title><link>https://mgurov.github.io/talks/mockless-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 21:04:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mgurov.github.io/talks/mockless-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mocking and stubbing are, without any doubt, important techniques for a modern software developer to master.

An an enterprise developer, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get used to the conveniences of Spring (Boot) so much that it becomes an issue on itself. Take @Transactional. Arguably, one of the few core features of Spring that does make us more productive in development. But at times it can be slightly inconvenient to rely solely on annotation for transaction boundary setup:
It might not be desireable to have a database transaction open throughout the whole request processing, e.</description></item><item><title>Java Integration Tests v Spring Context – when less is more</title><link>https://mgurov.github.io/posts/0001-integration_tests_v_spring/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2019 23:13:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mgurov.github.io/posts/0001-integration_tests_v_spring/</guid><description>&lt;p>When doing integration testing within a Spring (Boot) based project, we tend to use some sort of Spring context. Setting it up isn&amp;rsquo;t free. Careless tests composition can lead to much time wasted on re-creating those contexts, and will make running tests painfully long very quickly. There are simple techniques of keeping this overhead to the minimum. Ideally – start only one test context for the whole run.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
