Setting it up isn&rsquo;t free. Careless tests composition can lead to much time wasted on re-creating those contexts, and will make running tests painfully long very quickly. There are simple techniques of keeping this overhead to the minimum. Ideally – start only one test context for the whole run.</p><h2><a href=/notes/0004-programmatic-spring-transactional/>Spring @Transactional programmatically</a></h2><p>An an enterprise developer, it&rsquo;s easy to get used to the conveniences of Spring (Boot) so much that it becomes an issue on itself. Take <code>@Transactional</code>. Arguably, one of the few core features of Spring that does make us more productive in development. But at times it can be slightly inconvenient to rely solely on annotation for transaction boundary setup:</p><ul><li>It might not be desireable to have a database transaction open throughout the whole request processing, e.g if we do external calls to collect more data, thus introducing latencies that might deplete our db connection pool.</li><li>It might also be inconvenient and clumsy to set the transactional boundaries exactly at the methods, in particular when it ought to be accessed via proxy only (TODO: a link to the details).</li></ul><p>The simplest approach to overcome this inconvenience is to introduce a simple transactional helper:</p><h2><a href=/talks/kotlin-for-testability/>Sugar rush of Kotlin for your tests</a></h2><p>Why do teams prefer Kotlin for their tests, even when their production code stays in Java?</p><p>Learn how Kotlin&rsquo;s syntax helps keep tests clean, expressive and concise.</p><h2><a href=/talks/external-context/>WIP: External domain context with Ktor and Kotlin DSL for expressive and resilient testing</a></h2>Learn how to build meaningful functional tests in isolation. The highlights of this technique are the minimal deviation from the production configuration or code, and very limited use of mocking. Thanks to higher tier positioning on the testing pyramid, the tests written with this technique are quite implementation-agnostic, and excel in supporting structural refactorings or high-level documentation of the component behavior.<h2><a href=/talks/mockless-testing/>WIP – Mocks: is more always better?</a></h2><p>Mocking and stubbing are, without any doubt, important techniques for a modern software developer to master. But can there be too much of the mocking goodness?</p></main><footer><p>Anno 2025</p></footer></body></html>
