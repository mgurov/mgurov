Way too often, teams end up with gazillions of tests that don’t provide much confidence but rather slow down the delivery rate, or simply get chronically ignored.</p><p>The goal of this session is to demonstrate, how to refocus tests from the unit or e2e to the middle layer - wholistic system tests in isolation. And how these &ldquo;app&rdquo; tests can combine the best of both worlds: the control and predictability of the unit tests, and the holistic perspective of the E2E test. This makes it into a powerful technique that allows us to build test suites that are resilient to changes and yield more return on investment over time instead of burning it.</p><p>We have successfully used this strategy for back-end and front-end projects. It allowed our teams to break the dependency on manual verification of releases, and increase the pace of delivery from weeks to hours.</p><p>We will use <a href=https://playwright.dev/>Playwright</a> browser testing framework to demonstrate the key concepts of this technique.</p><h4 id=past>Past</h4><p>January 2025 <a href=https://viennajs.org/en/meetup/viennajs-january-meetup>ViennaJS Meetup</a> - a prototype delivery</p><hr></main><footer><p>Anno 2025</p></footer></body></html>
